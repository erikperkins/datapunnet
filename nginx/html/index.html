  This website is intended to be an exhibition of different web development and
  data science techniques. Architecturally, it consists of several applications
  implemented in different languages and frameworks, organized in a service-oriented
  fashion. External APIs are employed as well, to collect data and distribute
  computations. The user interface is implemented via a collection of JavaScript
  and CSS libraries.
</p>

<p>
  In greater detail, the composition of this site is as follows. The application
  infrastructure consists of
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon Web Services EC2 for hosting</li>
  <li>CircleCI for continuous integration</li>
  <li>Github for version control</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL for structured data storage</li>
  <li>Amazon Web Services S3 for unstructured data storage</li>
  <li>Amazon Web Services EMR for distributed computing</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The application implementation has the following components
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby on Rails for the main application functionality</li>
  <li>Python/Django for machine learning processes</li>
  <li>Haskell/Snap for user authentication</li>
  <li>Scala/Scalatra for distributed computing with Spark</li>
  <li>AngularJS for the user interface</li>
  <li>D3JS for data visualization</li>
  <li>Bootstrap for styling</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The three subordinate applications expose RESTful JSON APIs, through which the main
  Rails application communicates with them via ActiveResource. In the main
  application, some functionality is extracted to a Rails engine. The Scala/Scalatra
  application uses categorical design patterns (monoids, applicative functors,
  monads, algebraic data types, etc.) wherever possible, while the Haskell/Snap
  application uses these patterns essentially by default.
